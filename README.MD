# Project Name
The Gentleman
## üß† Concept

The Goal for The Gentleman stemmed from my experience working in retail at River Island. I‚Äôve always had a passion for fashion, but it was during my time there that I developed a deeper appreciation particularly for the more refined, professional style. This experience shaped my vision to create a website tailored to a specific demographic: men aged 27 to 37. My aim was to design a high-end, exclusive platform that not only celebrates sophisticated menswear, but also embodies the cultural essence of being a gentleman capturing both the style and the conduct that define modern masculinity.
